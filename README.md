Writing citations for research papers is time-consuming!

Great news, NCBIâ€™s databases (web API) are accessible using Python. Thus, this program can create MLA citations for the first *five* articles found.

Here's a [step-by-step tutorial](https://yingli.dev/blog/posts/2020-01-30-generate-citations-with-python.html) on how I wrote the program.

## How it works 
When running the script in terminal, you will be asked to enter search terms to find your articles. Results will display the PubMed ID and citation for each of the five articles. 

For example, the search terms "big data ETL" results in (only 1 out of 5 shown): 
```
python3 main.py 
Please enter a search for PubMed articles: big data ETL

```
